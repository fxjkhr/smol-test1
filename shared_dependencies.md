2. **Class and ID Names**: The class and ID names assigned to HTML elements in "index.html" will be used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" to apply specific styles. For example, classes like `.header`, `.nav`, `.main`, `.section`, `.article`, `.footer`, etc. and IDs like `#header`, `#nav`, `#main`, `#section`, `#article`, `#footer`, etc.

3. **CSS Properties**: The CSS properties used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be applied to the HTML elements in "index.html". These properties may include but are not limited to: `font-family`, `color`, `background-color`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, etc.

4. **Tailwind CSS Classes**: The Tailwind CSS classes used in "tailwind.css" will be applied to the HTML elements in "index.html". These classes may include but are not limited to: `.text-center`, `.bg-white`, `.mt-4`, `.p-4`, `.border`, etc.

5. **Font**: The font "Times New Roman" will be used across all HTML elements, defined in both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css".
